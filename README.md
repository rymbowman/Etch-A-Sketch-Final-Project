This is an Etch-A-Sketch project created as part of the Odin Project Foundations Course. The project allows users to draw on a grid by moving their mouse over the grid cells. Users can select the size of the grid, choose between black and random colors, and reset the grid. This project helped me learn various JavaScript skills which consisted of DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with CSS styles dynamically.
